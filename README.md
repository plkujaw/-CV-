## Kuba Jawor

Highly motivated and positively driven career changer. Has decided for transition to contribute in making positive impact through technology.

Since January 2020 has been learning with [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech) how to achieve it by using the best practices in the tech industry.

## Skills

#### Adaptability
Being able to move to live and work in the different country and fully adapt to the new reality is the best proof that one can handle any changes.

#### Empathy
In my previous roles it was crucial to look at projects from clients' point of view. Effective communication within all participating teams allows to understand expectations and tailor solutions to fully meet them.
