# Kuba Jawor

## Background

In 2019 I have decided to change my career. I wanted a job that would make me feel that I am a part of something meaningful, that with my work I make a positive impact. I believe that it is achievable through technology more than anything else. Because my recent roles were focused on or around technology, and I have always been keen on it I wanted to combine it all. That is why and how I found and joined renowned software development bootcamp – [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech).

## Skills

- Moving and living abroad has greatly improved my **adaptability** skill.
- Expectation of high-quality services and products has sharpened my **strong attention to detail**.
- Thanks to my previous roles and opportunity to work with different clients on different projects I have become an **empathetic team player**.
- At [Makers](https://makers.tech) I have got familiar with foundations of **software/web development** – Ruby, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript; programming concepts/design – OOP, Domain Modeling, MVC; processes/methodologies – TDD, pair programming, Agile; tools – GitHub, Heroku, Travis CI.

## Hobbies and Interests

In free time I discover new music and expand my vinyl records [collection](https://www.discogs.com/user/plkujaw/collection).
Since "A reader lives a thousand lives", if not listening to any LPs, I spend time reading.
When outdoors I feed my curiosity and explorer’s element during hikes, road trips and camping. I record them on digital and analogue [photographs](https://www.hireacamera.com/en-gb/blog/case-studies/customer-case-study-visiting-the-four-corners-of-the-uk-with-the-fujifilm-xe2-xf18-135mm/).
