# Kuba Jawor

## Background

I’m highly motivated and positively driven career changer. In 2019 I have decided to contribute in making a positive social and environmental change. I believe that today it is possible with technology more than anything else. That is why and how I found and joined renowned software development bootcamp – [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech).

## Skills

- Moving and living abroad has greatly improved my **adaptability** skill.

- Expectation of high-quality services and products has sharpened my **strong attention to detail**.

- In my previous roles, working with different clients on different projects has made me **empathetic**.

- Makers Academy has made me familiar with **software/web development** tools (Ruby, JavaScript, HTML/CSS), programming concepts/design (OOP, Domain Modeling, MVC), processes/methodologies (TDD, pair programming, Agile teamwork).
