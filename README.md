# Kuba Jawor

## Background

In 2019 I have decided to change my career. I wanted a job that would allow me to make a real difference to people’s lives, which would make me feel that I deliver something more than just a financial value, that with my work I make a positive impact. I believe that it is achievable through technology more than anything else. Because my recent roles were focused on or around technology, and I have always been keen on it I wanted to combine it all. That was why and how I found and joined renowned software development bootcamp – [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech).

## Skills

#### Adaptability
Being able to move to live and work in the different country and fully adapt to the new reality is a great proof that I can handle any change.

#### Empathy
In my previous roles it was crucial to look at projects from clients' point of view. Effective communication within all participating teams allows to understand expectations and tailor solutions to fully meet them.
